			"paragraph-1": "The age-old debate of Bus vs. Train has always been a point of contention for many. From childhood, it was one of the most discussed topics when planning a vacation. The choice was often determined by factors like the speed of travel, comfort, and price.",
			"paragraph-2": "This stereotype has to do with the fact that, if you live somewhere between Montreal and Washington, D.C., Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor route is the closest thing that North America has to European or Japanese high-speed rail travel. It is fast, it is convenient and it comes at a price that does not leave you feeling like you should be getting more than just being brought from place to place. The bus is the “alternative” and “cheap” option. West Coasters tend to have this stereotype less simply because, due to the much larger distances between cities, often neither bus or train is an option. The train routes that exist — the Amtrak Cascades corridor that I have once taken from Vancouver to Seattle and the Rocky Mountaineer which tourists often book as a multi-day luxury journey through the Canadian West with the accompanying price point) — are often seen as a scenic experience rather than only a mode of transportation. And if you’re spending more than ten hours on a bus, you may as well be flying.",
